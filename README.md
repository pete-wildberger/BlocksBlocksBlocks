Originally a jQuery exercise.  Went back over this exercise on the Vanilla branch to practice raw JavaScript skills.  The assignment was made into 3 difficulty levels.

Base: 
In your index.html, create a button that makes a square box every time it is clicked.
Add a rule in your stylesheet to make each of your boxes appear inline (i.e. they will appear next to each other).
When a box is clicked on, change its color to black.

Hard:

When each box is first generated, give it a randomly assigned color.
You can use the following code for your random functionality.
```function randomNumber(min, max){
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * (1 + max - min) + min);
}
```

Pro:
Add an 'x' in each box that allows the user to completely remove a box.
